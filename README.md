# LeetCode-Swift
Swift solutions for LeetCode problems with test cases!

These are being used as practice problems, so I'm not consulting existing solutions or discussion sections. As a result, these are not references for the *best* solutions to each of these problems, but all solutions have been submitted to (and accepted by) LeetCode unless noted otherwise in a solution's file header.

To compile and run the test cases for a solution, just enter

`swift /path/to/file.swift`

in the Terminal.
