# LeetCode-Swift
Swift solutions for LeetCode problems with unit tests!

These are being used as practice problems, so I'm not consulting existing solutions or discussion sections.

The solutions themselves are in the root-level "Solutions" folder; however, before being submitted, the problem number will need to be removed from the Solution class.

E.g., the first line

`class Solution1 {`

in "1. Two Sum.swift" will need to be replaced with

`class Solution {`

before submitting.
